# Code Folder

This folder contains code files for your project.
Main Analysis file is the one to run which contains all of the coding for the project and analysis. 

All data preparation, sample construction, variable creation, model estimation, etc. is contained in the file.

This analysis examines the effect of minimum wage increases on poverty within the U.S. between 2010-2023 using state-year data. Main methods that were utilized are staggered difference-in-differences and two-way fixed effects. 

All results can be found in the paper, and the code is commented on relatively frequently and shouldn't be too hard to follow. 

Opening the main analysis and running it should work. I used relative file paths, but my folder structure may have been a bit odd on my computer, so if the data doesn't load in or there is an error then that is likely the issue.

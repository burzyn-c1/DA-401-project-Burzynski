# DA401 Capstone Project - [Calvin Burzynski]

## Project Title
Beyond Employment: Evaluating the Poverty-Reducing Effects of Minimum Wage Increases in the United States

## Research Question
Do state minimum wage increases (2018â€“2023) reduce poverty among full-time low-wage workers in the U.S.?

## Data Source
-ACS/IPUMS
-DOL
-BLS
-BEA
-FRED
## Methods
Parallel trends testing, clustering (inference), difference-in-differences, sensitivity checks

## Expected Timeline
I expect to produce something new or revelant to the project each week. This could be in the form of a paper that outlines my methodology, literature, and research design, to cleaning the data and identifying key discrepencies in the literature that I should be aware of during my analysis. There is a lot of data that I am working with, so being able to work with the data in Rstudio/Jupyter Notebook each week will be a priority.
